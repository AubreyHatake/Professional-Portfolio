# Professional-Portfolio
This site contains my resume and work experience to help future employers to better get to know me. 
A lot of this site does not include much work, this is due to not having much work to display, yet! 

## User Story 

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## My HTML 
 In this site I was able to play around with formatting on HTML to create a portfolio to display future applications and deployed websites. 
I was able to work on this assignment independently, meaning I coded everything from scratch! 

## Mock up 
I realize now that this site was suppose to mock the assignment on the Challenge page on canvas, this website, obviously, does not look like the mock up site. This of course is due to me not reading the entire page before working entirely on this site. I will not have time to clean up and fix my site to mimic the mock up site ufortunately, grade accordingly. ðŸ˜”
